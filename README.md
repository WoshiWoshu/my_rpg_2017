# my_rpg_2017
First year project in C, in which the goal was to built a old school 90's style RPG game using CSFML. There is a nice storyline with bosses and several quests. The game include as well NPC character, inventory with items, experience/level up points system, maps, physics (walls, fences etc..) and character movement.
